E-Commerce Market Insights


Project Overview


This project provides a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce transaction data to extract valuable business insights. It covers customer acquisition, retention, revenue trends, marketing impact, product demand, and customer behavior using data analytics, machine learning, and visualization techniques.



Key Objectives

Revenue Calculation: Compute invoice values at the transaction and item level 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Monthly customer acquisition and retention trends.

Revenue trends for new vs. existing customers.

Impact of discounts on revenue.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, order count, customer segments, average order value, etc.

Seasonality trends in sales by category, location, and time.

Scientific Approach: Use K-Means Clustering to segment customers and define strategies for each group.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction:
Define customer revenue categories (Low, Medium, High).
Build a classification model to predict customer CLV.

Cross-Selling & Market Basket Analysis:
Identify products frequently purchased together to optimize bundling.

Next Purchase Prediction:
Predict customer return probability within different time windows (0-30, 30-60, 60-90, 90+ days) using classification modeling.

Cohort Analysis:
Analyze customer cohorts based on the month of acquisition.
Determine retention rates across cohorts.


Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
Machine Learning: Classification models for CLV and Next Purchase Prediction
